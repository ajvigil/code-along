//simplification of a process we don't have to know about - but we can still use it
// aka driving a car, we don't know how it works but we still use it

//functions that are called upon other functions are higher order functions

//the basics of arrow functions

// let func = (arg1, arg2, arg3) => expression

//SAME AS

// let func = function (arg1, arg2, arg3) {
//     return expression;
// }
